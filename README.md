# Hi there! I’m **María** 👋

*Even if my résumé doesn’t scream “Designer by birth,” trust me—my radar for awful user experiences is always on.*

---

## Who am I?
- A web developer currently working in **Spain**, sharpening my skill set every single day.  
- A professional with an unconventional background that taught me how to adapt fast, understand even faster, and deliver meaningful results.  
- Yes, I come from the **UX/UI** world, but if you look at my CV you might say, “Really? Where does it say so?” Well, right here, in my README.

## Why do I focus on user experience?
Because there’s nothing worse than software seemingly built to make us suffer. From the very first sketch, I think about how people will *actually* use the application. If the final result doesn’t make you feel at home, something went wrong.

## How do I work?
1. **Maximum Curiosity** – I question everything. Even the recipe for a proper Spanish tortilla (though tradition often hides wisdom).  
2. **Consistency & Continuous Learning** – Every project is a chance to explore something new. My motto:  
   *“Today I know more than yesterday, and tomorrow more than today (unless memes distract me).”*  
3. **Details, Details, Details** – It may not appear in bold neon letters on my CV, but a passion for good design and clean development runs through my veins.

## A touch of humor (because code without humor is boring)
> *I’m one of those people who, when discovering something is possible, jumps in without a parachute. I ask, investigate, break, fix… then break again (just to be sure).*  

*(And yes, I’m a **woman**—got to say it loud & proud.)*

## What will you find on my GitHub?
- Projects that help me learn something new (and occasionally unlearn the obsolete).  
- Crazy ideas tested with **TypeScript, React, .NET, SQL**—any tech that catches my eye. *(Work in progress!)*  
- A constant effort to implement best practices and keep the code clean, even if my first drafts look like beautiful chaos.

## Why should you care?
Because I bet on **logic, clarity,** and the *practical* use of technology. I’m not interested in “doing more and more”; I prefer **doing it better**. And yes, I love taking user experience to a level that leaves no one itching to throw their keyboard out the window.
