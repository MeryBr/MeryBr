# Hi! I'm María 👋

I'm a web developer with a sharp eye for detail and a healthy obsession with user experience.  
Before writing code, I spent years helping people and solving real-life problems.  
Now I do the same — but with code.

---

## What drives me?

- **User experience**: everything should be intuitive, visually appealing, and easy to use.  
- **Details matter**: if something’s off — visually, functionally, technically — I catch it.  
- **Quality first**: I don’t let things slide. If it can be improved, I improve it.  
- **Purpose-driven work**: I’m not here to “just build” — I’m here to make things **make sense**.

---

## What will you find on my GitHub?

- Personal projects where I experiment, build, and refine with intention.  
- Clean, functional code designed with the user in mind.  
- Always aiming for that one feedback: *“This feels great to use.”*

**Currently training and growing with these tools — learning hands-on through code, errors, fixes,  
and small wins that stack up — breaking things (on purpose) and getting sharper every day.**

## 📚 Currently learning

I'm enrolled in an intensive 11-month **Frontend Master at Lemoncode**, focused on real-world development with:

- **React, TypeScript, Angular, Vue, Svelte**  
- **Figma, CSS animations, responsive layout**  
- **Unit testing (Jest, Vitest), CI/CD, Docker**  
- **REST APIs, GraphQL, OAuth2, Socket.io**  
- **Cloud deployment (Azure, AWS, Render)**

Built around agile methodology, frequent code reviews, and Git-based collaboration.  
Because theory is nice — but practice is what makes it stick.
